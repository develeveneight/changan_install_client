# Changan Install Client Source Code

Welcome to the source code repository of the **Changan Install** client.
### [Download client binaries](https://github.com/develeveneight/changa_install_client/releases)
## Important Information
The `tools` folder applications have been removed from the project. Please add them manually as needed.

This repository contains **only the client-side** source code. The server-side code is closed and will not be shared. However, if you wish to implement the server-side logic yourself, you can refer to the interaction logic described in the classes within the `server.py` file. 

**Note:** `server.py` is not a server itself; rather, it is a module containing classes that facilitate communication with the server.

## Purpose

These source codes are provided for research purposes only and do not claim to be clean or perfectly structured.
